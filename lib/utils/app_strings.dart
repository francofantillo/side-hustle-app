      "At 22 years old, freshly separated from the military, I found myself on vacation in San Francisco, California. During a memorable weekend, I visited a Leonardo da Vinci exhibit showcasing scaled-down models of his inventions, from parachutes to ball bearings. Amidst my awe for these remarkable creations, I stumbled upon a model of a small city, prompting a profound question: "
      "Had this man discovered the blueprint for a perfect city? To this day, that question remains unanswered, but it ignited a concept that continues to fuel my passion. This experience led me to contemplate the essence of a perfect city, emphasizing one vital element: circulation—the seamless flow of goods and resources within a community.";
  static const String flyerUnderCapitalismTextTwo =
      "The thought of circulation led me to ponder the Local Circulation of Money (LCM). In many cities, monopolies, represented by giant chain stores like Wal-Mart, drain substantial amounts of money from the local economy, leaving minimal returns. This financial drain cripples the LCM, hindering the city's economic growth and prosperity.";
  static const String flyerUnderCapitalismTextThree =
      "As responsible neighbors and citizens, it is our duty to reinforce the LCM by supporting one another, enhancing the circulation of money within our communities. Large corporations, akin to winners in a Monopoly game, often dominate the economic landscape. To counter this, I envisioned United Capitalism—a concept aimed at empowering ordinary people to compete with these monopolies. This vision materialized into the Side Hustle app, a platform designed to give individuals a chance to participate actively in their local economies.";
  static const String flyerUnderCapitalismTextFour =
      "The Side Hustle app, in its initial stages, serves as a basic tool to facilitate local transactions. However, my aspiration is to evolve it into a platform promoting "
      "Repetitious Cyclical Patterns of Money."
      " This concept involves establishing a chain of transactions among neighbors, allowing them to nurture their side hustles and break free from the chains of the system. Starting a business demands substantial resources, especially when competing against colossal franchises. Yet, the potential for success is evident; anyone can create a superior product, like a healthier cheeseburger, compared to what large corporations offer. The missing element has always been a supportive community platform.";
  static const String flyerUnderCapitalismTextFive =
      "Imagine our neighbor Jimmy using the Side Hustle app to announce, "
      "I'm grilling cheeseburgers in my driveway this Saturday."
      " When our community rallies behind Jimmy, we provide him with more than just financial support. We give him hope—a chance to break free from a job he dislikes, in a place he despises, working with people he cannot stand. By challenging the system, we offer Jimmy the opportunity to plan a new, brighter future.";
  static const String flyerUnderCapitalismTextSix =
      "In essence, United Capitalism and the Side Hustle app are not just about financial transactions; they represent the embodiment of hope and the power of communities working together.
